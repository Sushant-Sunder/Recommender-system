Recommender-system on Reddit posts

Reddit ranks among the most widely used discussion platforms in the United States, where
millions of users interact daily by sharing images and posts that garner varying levels of upvotes and
comments. But what factors make certain posts more likely to attract significant engagement? When
is the best time to post to maximize visibility and popularity? Does Reddit mirror the ”celebrity
effect” seen on platforms like Twitter? And how does the wording of a title influence a post’s success?
This study delves into these questions by analyzing a dataset of Reddit submissions. Utilizing
techniques such as k-means clustering, linear regression, and TF-IDF modeling, we investigate the
elements that drive post-popularity and assess the prediction of no. of comments a post can receive.
The findings offer a deeper understanding of content creation and engagement patterns on Reddit,
either confirming or challenging widely held beliefs about what makes a post thrive.
